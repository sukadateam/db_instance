# db_instance
Just another attempt at a database handler in Python. This version uses class instances per database. Work in progress!

The usage case for this version is for use in new learner applications and to be comepletly native to python built in structure with no dependencies. I am currently building the outline of how I want this handler to function and be used. After which, more advanced features will be implemented but with no further complications. It will all be done by the handler. 

This inlcudes but is not limited to, and may change in future refenerce:
  1) Encryption
  2) Redundecny
  3) Backups
  4) Error Management
  5) Local tcp connection(s) - No ota allowed.


This handler is written by and supported by:
  - Brandon R. (Me) # Main Writter
  - Dakota H. (Me Friend :)-) # Error debugging and part time writter
